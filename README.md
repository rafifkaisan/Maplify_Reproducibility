üåç Overview

"Where NASA meets Urban Resilience, Data meets Innovation"

Cities are growing faster than ever. By 2050, nearly 70% of the world‚Äôs population will live in urban areas, creating new challenges: floods, pollution, commuting inefficiencies, and loss of green cover. NASA satellites provide detailed environmental and urban datasets, but translating these into actionable urban insights is complex.

Maplify transforms NASA open data into a city-scale decision-support tool for smarter, greener, and more resilient urban living. Our demo computes MAPLIFY_SCORES for sample neighborhoods in Dhaka, using population density, flood risk, vegetation index, pollution, and commute times.

‚ö†Ô∏è The Critical Challenge

Increasing urban population density

Rising flood & pollution risk

Poor commute & infrastructure planning

Limited accessible, actionable data for urban planners



---

üõ∞Ô∏è Maplify Solution

Maplify leverages NASA datasets and open-source geospatial tools to:

1. Identify flood-prone areas


2. Highlight low-green, high-density neighborhoods


3. Estimate commute efficiency


4. Generate an overall MAPLIFY_SCORE per location


5. Provide a reproducible pipeline using open-source scripts & datasets

‚ú® Key Features

Satellite Data Integration

VIIRS Black Marble (nighttime lights / urban density proxy)

MODIS NDVI (green cover index)

MODIS LST (land surface temperature anomaly)

IMERG 30-day precipitation (flood proxy)

AOD (pollution proxy)

SEDAC GPW (population density)


MAPLIFY Score Computation

Normalizes all inputs to 0‚Äì100

Weighted formula:

MAPLIFY_SCORE = round(
    commute_score * 0.25 +
    flood_score   * 0.25 +
    pollution_score * 0.20 +
    density_score * 0.15 +
    green_score   * 0.15
)


Reproducibility

Fully documented pipeline (clip, aggregate, normalize, score)

Sample files in /layers/ for demonstration

Python script recomputes scores automatically


Educational / Demonstration Value

Showcases satellite-based urban analytics

Allows judges to reproduce demo in <30 minutes

üìê Reproducible Steps

1. Download NASA data for your bounding box (VIIRS, IMERG, MODIS NDVI/LST, AOD, GPW).


2. Clip to area of interest using GDAL (gdalwarp -te <lonmin> <latmin> <lonmax> <latmax>).


3. Aggregate IMERG to 24h/30d totals using Python xarray.


4. Compute NDVI mean & LST anomalies from MODIS stacks.


5. Run MAPLIFY score script:

python scripts/compute_maplify_score.py --input seed_listings.csv --output-json seed_listings_scored.json --output-csv seed_listings_scored.csv


6. Export demo tiles for /layers/ folder.
