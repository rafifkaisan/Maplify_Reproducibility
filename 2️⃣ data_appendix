Data Appendix — worked example: Housing Score for “Dhanmondi Studio”

Coordinates: (90.354, 23.674)

Raw inputs (example):
- GPW density: 10,697 people/km²
- VIIRS radiance: decile check
- MODIS NDVI mean: 0.354
- IMERG 30-day rainfall total: 60 mm
- MODIS AOD: 0.10
- Commute: 24 minutes

Normalization (demo):
commute_score = 72.0  
flood_score = 100.0  
pollution_score = 86.21  
density_score = 73.26  
green_score = 35.40  

Weighted sum:
MAPLIFY_SCORE = 77/100 — “Good: Low flood risk, moderate commute, moderate green cover.”

Include thumbnails of VIIRS, NDVI, IMERG snapshots.

Repro steps:
- gdalwarp clip VIIRS  
- xarray sum IMERG 30 days  
- compute NDVI mean  
- run compute_maplify_score.py  

Confidence & notes:
- density mapping uses quantile remapping;  
- flood thresholds locally calibrated.
